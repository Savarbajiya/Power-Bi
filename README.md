E-Commerce-Sales-Data-Analysis-Using Power BI

Project Overview:
E-commerce businesses generate massive amounts of sales data, but extracting meaningful insights to optimize performance can be challenging. Traditional methods are often time-consuming and lack the visual clarity needed to identify trends and customer behavior. This is akin to sifting through mountains of unorganized information â€“ while the data is there, it requires significant effort to clean, analyze, and transform it into actionable knowledge. This project proposes a solution: a comprehensive Power BI report that acts as a compass, guiding us through this vast data landscape. By leveraging Power BI's visualizations, we can better understand of orders, product performance, customer trends, and profitability. This analysis will empower data-driven decisions to optimize pricing, target marketing efforts, and ultimately drive business growth.

Data Source:
Flipkart Sales Dataset- This dataset is initially available in "xlsx" format, which is used for the analysis "Flipkart Sales Dataset.xlsx" file, which contains the details of the sales.

Tools:
